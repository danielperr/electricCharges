# Electric Charges

**This project features a simulation of electric charges moving in 2d space, illustration of coulomb's law.**

### Controls
* Place positive charges using left-click, negative ones using right-click.

When two charges collide, they share their charge and "spread" it out evenly between the two.

### Todo List
* Add adjustable charge when placing charges
* Add pause / resume button
* Add time multiplier
* Add a delete tool
* Add option for placing a fixed charge, one that is fixed in place and doesn't move.
* Add friction
