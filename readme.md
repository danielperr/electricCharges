# Electric Charges

**This project features a simulation of electric charges moving in 2d space, illustration of coulomb's law.**

### Controls
* Place positive charges using left-click, negative ones using right-click.

When two charges collide, they share their charge and "spread" it out evenly between the two.
The charge's color intensity tells how strong the charge is. Blue is for positive charges, red is for negative charges.

### Todo List
* Add adjustable charge power when placing charges
* Add pause / resume button
* Add time multiplier
* Add a delete tool
* Add option for placing a fixed charge, one that is fixed in place and doesn't move.
* Add friction
